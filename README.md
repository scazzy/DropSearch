# DropSearch
HTML Dropdown + Quck search, Lightweight, fully customisable

DropSearch is a lightweight <select> dropdown customizer, that translates your existing dropdown into a pure HTML/CSS based dropdown. DropSearch by default allows QuickSearch to quickly search from your dropdown context.

DropSearch works out of box and keeps your <select> intact so your data is reflected in your form.

DropSearch uses jQuery for DOM manipulation, and [Fuse](https://github.com/krisk/fuse) for search algorithm. Fuse helps search incorrect keywords and suggest relevant results.
